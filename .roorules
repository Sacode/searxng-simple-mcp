## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Package Management**: UV for fast, reliable dependency resolution
- **Build System**: Flit for simplified Python packaging
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Conventions

- **Code Style**: Enforced by ruff and mypy with strict type checking
- **Documentation**: Minimal docstrings for public members only. Documentation should be concise and to the point
- **Data Structures**: All data structures must be implemented as Pydantic classes rather than dictionaries, dataclasses, or other similar structures
- **Type Definitions**: Types must be defined in separate files (e.g., `types.py`) within each module
- **Code Simplicity**: Follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple). Code should be straightforward and understandable. Avoid unnecessary design patterns and over-engineering
- **Pydantic Validation**: Always use the simplest validation approach with Pydantic V2, such as Field constraints instead of custom validators whenever possible
